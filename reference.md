# The epher language reference

*Version 0.5.41 (staging). This page is the formal, normative definition
of the epher language: its lexical rules, grammar, types, operators,
statements, built-in constants and functions, units, display rules,
errors, and limits. Every name and every signature here is extracted
from the evaluating engine itself (the `epher-core` crate), not from
prose.*

The [user guide](../guide/en/) teaches the language by example; this
reference defines it exactly. Where the two appear to disagree, this
page wins, and the disagreement is a bug worth
[filing](https://github.com/upyesp/epher/issues).

## 1. Notation

- `code` spells a token, expression, or statement exactly as written.
- *italic* names in the grammar name non-terminals.
- "number" without qualification means a real value; "complex" includes
  reals as the special case with zero imaginary part.
- Signatures write built-in calls the way you type them:
  `hypot(a, b)`.
- Every example in a code block is engine-verified: the `epher` block
  evaluates, the `text` block is what the engine answers.

## 2. Program structure

An epher *program* (a script file, a pasted block, a piped stdin, or a
REPL line) is a sequence of *statements* separated by `;` or by a
newline. Both separators are equivalent; `;` never terminates a
statement, it separates statements, so an empty statement is not an
error and leading, trailing, and doubled separators are allowed.

The value of a program is the value of its last statement that produced
one. A statement that produces no value (for example an `if` without an
`else` whose condition is false, or `break`) is skipped when the
program's value is collected; a program whose statements all produce no
value answers nothing.

Comments come in three kinds:

```epher
# a line comment, from # to end of line
2 + 2      // another line comment, from // to end of line
/* an inline comment */ 4 * 4
/* a block comment may span
   several lines */
```

```text
4
16
```

`#`, `//`, and `/* ... */` may appear between any two tokens. Newlines
inside a block comment do not separate statements; the comment's
closing `*/` is required, and its absence is a parse error.

A statement is one of: an assignment, a constant definition, a function
definition, a destructuring, `if`, `while`, `for`, `solve`, `return`,
`break`, `continue`, or an expression. The full grammar is given in
[The complete grammar](#15-the-complete-grammar-ebnf).

## 3. Lexical grammar

### 3.1 Numbers

- Decimal: digits with an optional fractional part (`3`, `3.5`, `.5`)
  and an optional decimal-exponent suffix (`2e3`, `1.5E-3`, `2e+2`).
  The exponent needs at least one digit, so `2e` and `2eggs` tokenize
  as the number `2` followed by a name.
- Based integers (ADR-0022): `0b` binary, `0o` octal, `0x`
  hexadecimal — `0b101`, `0o17`, `0xFF`. Digits after the prefix must
  suit the base. A base prefix changes the spelling, never the value:
  `0xFF` *is* `255`.
- Imaginary suffix (ADR-0043): a number directly followed by `i`, with
  no letter or `_` after the `i`, is one imaginary literal: `4i`,
  `2.5i`, `0xFFi`. `3 + 4i` is a sum of two literals. `4it` is
  *not* imaginary — it is the number `4` followed by the name `it`,
  which the grammar then rejects.
- All numbers are 64-bit binary floats. Integers are exact up to
  2^53; beyond that, spelling a literal keeps at most the 53 most
  significant bits.

### 3.2 Strings

A string literal is double quotes around any run of characters. Five
escapes exist (ADR-0064): `\n` newline, `\t` tab, `\r` carriage
return, `\\` backslash, `\"` quote. Any other escape is a parse error
that names the mistake, and a string cannot end on a lone backslash.

```epher
"line one\nline two"
"quote: \" backslash: \\"
```

```text
line one
line two
quote: " backslash: \
```

### 3.3 Names

A name starts with a letter or `_` and continues with letters, digits,
or `_`. Letters are Unicode; `atan2`, `log10`, and `x2` are names.
Names are case-sensitive: `G` and `g` are different constants.

## 4. Names and keywords

The following words are keywords. They cannot be written where a value
is expected, and they are recognized by exact spelling:

```
break   const   continue   def   do   else   end   for   if
in      not     or         and   return   solve   step
then    to      while      xor
```

`true` and `false` are **not** literals: booleans are produced only by
comparisons and predicates (`1 < 2`, `isprime(7)`), and a bare `true`
is an unknown-name error.

One further name is reserved: `i`, the imaginary unit. It cannot be
re-bound by assignment, by `const`, or by a destructuring pattern; see
[Names, scope, and the session store](#8-names-scope-and-the-session-store).
`i` is not a keyword — it resolves as a built-in constant and can be
shadowed by nothing.

## 5. Types and values

| Type | Written as | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Float (real number) | 64-bit binary float | `3`, `2.5`, `1e9` |
| Rational (exact fraction) | produced by `frac(n, d)`, `exact(x)` | `frac(1, 3)` |
| Decimal | produced by `dec(x)` | `dec(0.1)` |
| Big (exact integer/decimal) | produced by `big(x)`, bitwise results | `big(2) ^ 100` |
| Complex | imaginary literals, complex results | `3+4i`, `sqrt(-1)` |
| Boolean | comparisons and predicates only | `1 < 2`, `isprime(7)` |
| String | `"..."` | `"hello"` |
| List | `{a, b, c}` — a data column of reals, or a list of strings | `{1, 2, 3}`, `split("a b", " ")` |
| Matrix | `[[row], [row]]` — reals, row-major | `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` |
| Quantity | number with a unit suffix | `2 m`, `60 mile/hr` |

Notes:

- Lists hold numbers, or strings — not a mix. A complex element is
  rejected at construction.
- Matrices are reals only, stored row-major; matrix functions are in
  the [function index](#10-built-in-functions).
- A quantity is an SI value plus its seven base dimensions and an
  optional display unit; see [Units](#11-units).
- `ans` is a normal variable the frontend rebinds after each
  computation; it holds the previous answer.

The answer panel spells values as [Number display](#12-number-display)
defines.

## 6. Expressions and operators

### 6.1 Precedence, tightest to loosest

| Level | Operators | Associativity |
|---|---|---|
| Primary | literals, names, calls, `(…)`, `{…}`, `[[…]]` | — |
| Postfix | `!` factorial, `%` percent, `[…]` index | left |
| Power | `^` | right |
| Unary | `-` negate, `~` bit-not | — |
| Multiplicative | `*`, `/`, unit division `60 mile/hr` | left |
| Additive | `+`, `-`, unit conversion `in`, `->` | left |
| Shift | `<<`, `>>` | left |
| Bit-and | `&` | left |
| Bit-or | `\|`, `xor` | left |
| Comparison | `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=` | non-chaining |
| Not | `not` | — |
| And | `and` | left |
| Or | `or` | left |
| Conditional | `if c then a else b` (expression form) | — |

`-2 ^ 2` is `-4` (unary minus binds looser than the power);
`2 ^ -2` is `0.25` (the exponent may be unary);
`3! ^ 2` is `36`; `d[2] ^ 2` indexes first;
`not x > 3` is `not (x > 3)`;
`5 & 3 == 1` is `(5 & 3) == 1`.

### 6.2 Arithmetic

`+`, `-`, `*`, `/` work over reals and complex; a complex operand
computes in complex. `/` by zero is a division error. `^` is
right-associative; `0 ^ 0` is `1`.

- List arithmetic is elementwise: two same-length lists combine
  element by element, and a list combined with a scalar maps over the
  list. Different lengths are a type error.
- String `+` concatenates two strings; a string with a non-string is a
  type error (spell the number first with `str` or `fixed`).
- Unit suffixes ride through `+ - * /` with dimension checking; see
  [Units](#11-units).

### 6.3 Factorial and percent

`n!` is the factorial of a non-negative whole number. `x%` is exactly
`x / 100` — a transparent suffix, so `200 + 10%` is `200.1`; the
Casio add-on reading (`220`) is deliberately not a grammar rule.

### 6.4 Indexing

`expr[i]` indexes a list or string, **1-based**; the index is any
expression. A matrix indexed with one expression gives one whole row
as a list: `m[2]` is the second row.

### 6.5 Comparisons

`==` and `!=` compare any two values of the same kind; `<`, `<=`,
`>`, `>=` order numbers and strings (strings in dictionary/code-point
order). Complex values refuse ordering. Lists and matrices do not
compare. Comparisons return booleans, and comparisons do not chain:
`1 < 2 < 3` is a type error, not `(1 < 2) < 3`.

### 6.6 Booleans

`and`, `or`, `not` take booleans only and produce booleans. `and` and
`or` short-circuit: the right side is not evaluated when the left
decides. There is no truthiness: numbers are not booleans.

### 6.7 Bitwise operations

`&`, `|`, `xor`, `~`, `<<`, `>>` take integers (whole floats, exact
Big, integral rationals/decimals) and produce the exact result masked
to the session's word size — a signed two's-complement word of 8, 16,
32, or 64 bits, set with `bits(w)` and defaulting to 64. Right shift
is arithmetic; a negative shift amount reverses the direction.

## 7. Statements

### 7.1 Assignment: `name = expr`

Evaluates the expression and binds the name in the session. Rebinding
is allowed; binding `i` is refused (see below).

### 7.2 Constant definition: `const name = expr`

Binds an immutable name. Re-declaring with the *same* value succeeds —
examples get pasted twice; a different value is a
`constant already defined` error. Naming an existing variable is a
`cannot define constant x: the name is already a variable` error.

### 7.3 Destructuring: `{a, b} = expr` (ADR-0064)

The expression must be a list whose length equals the number of
pattern names; each name binds to its position's element. `_` skips a
position: `{x, _} = {1, 2}` binds only `x`. Names in the pattern
follow assignment rules (`i` refused, constants refused). The pattern
is recognized only when the statement *begins* with `{names} =`; a
`{1, 2}` at the start of a line stays the list expression it always
was.

### 7.4 Function definition: `def name(params) = expr` and `def name(params) do … end`

Two body forms. `= expr` evaluates the expression in a child
environment seeded with the arguments. `do … end` runs its statements
one after another in that child environment; the last statement's
value is the call's answer, and a body whose statements produce no
value is a named error. Recursion works in both forms. A call carries
its own 100,000-step budget. Parameters shadow session values only
inside the call.

### 7.5 `return`, `break`, `continue` (ADR-0064)

`return expr` leaves the enclosing function now, with the value;
`return` at top level (outside any function) is a named error.
`break` leaves the innermost enclosing `for` or `while`; `continue`
skips to its next pass. Outside a loop both are named errors. In a
`for` loop, a pass ended by `continue` contributes no value to the
collected list.

### 7.6 `if` as a statement: `if cond then stmt` / `if cond then stmt else stmt`

The condition must be a boolean. Without `else`, a false condition
produces no value — which is how a `for` loop filters: a pass whose
body produces no value adds nothing to the loop's list.

### 7.7 `while cond do stmt`

Evaluates the condition (which must be a boolean) and runs the
one-statement body until it is false, `break` fires, or the step
budget runs out. A `while` loop produces no value.

### 7.8 `for name in iterable do stmt` (ADR-0054, scoped per ADR-0063)

Two iterable forms: a range `start to end` (optionally `step s`), or
any expression evaluating to a list. The variable is bound per pass
and **removed afterwards**: the loop never leaves its variable in the
session, and a binding that existed before the loop is restored after
it. The loop's value is the list of the body's per-pass values.

### 7.9 `solve lhs == rhs` (ADR-0043)

Numeric equation solving — no CAS. The equation must use `==`. The
unknown is `x` when `x` appears, otherwise the single other name;
constants (built-in and user) are parameters, never unknowns. Real
roots in a wide search window are reported, as a display string:
`solve x^2 == 9` answers `x = -3, x = 3`.

### 7.10 Expression statements

Any expression, typically a call. Its value, when there is one,
becomes the statement's value.

## 8. Names, scope, and the session store

Name resolution tries, in order: session variables, then session
constants, then built-in constants, then built-in functions (a call),
then the error `unknown name`. A user function or constant shadows a
built-in of the same name.

- Session variables persist for the session and — in interactive
  frontends — across sessions and frontends of the same installation
  through the shared store (the `.epher` folder; the PWA keeps the
  same shape in browser storage).
- **The imaginary unit is reserved.** `i = 5`, `const i = …`, and a
  destructuring pattern naming `i` are all refused with
  `cannot assign to i: that name is the imaginary unit`, so no
  session, store, or frontend can shadow `3+4i`. A stored `i` from an
  older release is dropped silently when the store loads.
- A `for` loop's variable exists only for the loop: it is removed
  afterwards, and a prior binding is restored (nothing a loop does
  reaches the store).
- A `def`'s parameters and body live in a child environment: they
  shadow the session inside the call and cannot leak out. Assignments
  inside a function body are local to that call.
- `save name` asks the interactive frontend to persist a function or
  constant into the store; saving a *script* is a frontend command,
  not language (see
  [Beyond the grammar](#16-beyond-the-grammar-interactive-commands)).

## 9. Built-in constants

Values are SI throughout. A name's value is fixed by the engine; a
user `const` of the same name shadows it by the resolution order.

## 10. Built-in functions

Every callable the engine knows, grouped by domain. Argument shapes are
normative: `x` is a real number, `z` any number (complex allowed),
`n` a whole number, `s` a string, `L` a list. A call with the wrong
count or kinds is a type error that names the function, e.g.
`rad expects 1 number, got 1 argument(s)`.

[Statements](#7-statements).

## 11. Units

A number directly followed by a unit name is a **quantity** (ADR-0046):
the number times the unit's SI factor, carrying its dimensions.
`2 m` stores 2 with length dimensions; `60 mile/hr` stores
26.8224 m/s. Units may carry a whole-number power (`2 m^2`, powers to
±127) and a `/` may continue with another unit (`5 m/s^2`) — that is
unit syntax, not division, whenever a unit name follows. An SI prefix
may start a unit: `30 cm`, `5 kHz`, `3 ns`.

`x in unit` (or `x -> unit`) converts: `5 km in mile` answers
`3.10685596119 mile`, and the display unit sticks. Arithmetic checks
dimensions: adding `2 m` to `30 cm` gives `2.3 m`; adding a metre to
a second is a dimension error.

### 11.1 Prefixes

The 21 SI prefixes, as spellings before a unit: `da` (×10¹), `h` (×10²),
`k` (×10³), `M` (×10⁶), `G` (×10⁹), `T` (×10¹²), `P` (×10¹⁵),
`E` (×10¹⁸), `Z` (×10²¹), `Y` (×10²⁴), `d` (×10⁻¹), `c` (×10⁻²),
`m` (×10⁻³), `µ` or `u` (×10⁻⁶), `n` (×10⁻⁹), `p` (×10⁻¹²),
`f` (×10⁻¹⁵), `a` (×10⁻¹⁸), `z` (×10⁻²¹), `y` (×10⁻²⁴).

A quantity displays in its display unit when it has one (typed or
converted), otherwise in the SI spelling of its dimensions (`m/s^2`,
or the exact derived name when the dimensions match one: `N`, `W`,
`Pa`, …).

## 12. Number display

The answer panel's automatic spelling (ADR-0051):

- A float prints with up to **12 significant digits**, exact integers
  keeping every digit.
- **Exact fractions**: when a rational with denominator ≤ 1000 agrees
  with the value through all twelve displayed digits *and* is not a
  terminating decimal, the answer shows as a fraction — `1/3` stays
  `1/3`, while `0.1 + 0.2` shows `0.3`, not `3/10`.
- Complex answers print in `a+bi` form. Booleans print `true`/`false`.
  Lists print `{1, 2, 3}`; matrices print row by row: `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`.
- The display verbs (`scientific`, `engineering`, `grouped`, `fixed`,
  `bin`, `oct`, `hex`) return text, ready to `print` or `join`.

## 13. Errors

An error stops evaluation of the statement in progress; in a script
the whole run stops and the exit carries the message. Error classes,
with the verbatim shape of each message:

| Class | Example message |
|---|---|
| Parse | `unexpected character: '@'`; `expected digits after 0x`; `unknown escape \d in a string: the escapes are \n, \t, \r and \\`; `unterminated string: a literal needs its closing quote`; `unterminated block comment: expected */` |
| Type | `rad expects 1 number, got 1 argument(s)`; `if condition must be a boolean, got 3`; `and expects booleans, got 2`; `lists have different lengths: 3 and 1`; `cannot compare Complex(Complex { re: 3.0, im: 4.0 })` |
| Domain | `sqrt of negative number -4` (as a real); `asin of 2 outside -1..1`; `no prime below 2`; `factors of 0 must be a positive integer` |
| Division | `division by zero` |
| Name | `unknown name: nmae` |
| Constant/variable conflicts | `cannot assign to constant TAX`; `cannot define constant x: the name is already a variable` |
| Reserved name | `cannot assign to i: that name is the imaginary unit` |
| Control flow | `break outside a loop`; `continue outside a loop`; `return outside a function` |
| Limits | the step budget exhausted; `for runs at most 100000 iterations, got 100001` |
| Dimension | `cannot add m and s` (dimension mismatch); `cannot take the square root of 2 m: the dimensions do not divide evenly` |

## 14. Limits and determinism

- **Step budget**: every program run carries a 100,000-step budget;
  each function call gets its own fresh budget. Exhausting it stops
  the run.
- **For iterations**: a single `for` loop is capped at 100,000 passes.
- **Floats**: 64-bit binary; integers exact to 2^53.
- **Reproducibility**: the random generator is SplitMix64 with a
  Box–Muller step for `randn`; `randseed(n)` makes a sequence
  repeatable. Scripts evaluated by the checker pin a seed, so a
  script's transcript is byte-stable.
- **Display**: 12 significant digits, fractions only through
  denominator 1000.

## 15. The complete grammar (EBNF)

The grammar is written in EBNF, the Extended Backus–Naur Form. Each rule
names a construct and says how it is built: `,` joins parts in sequence,
`|` separates alternatives, `[ … ]` marks a part that may be absent,
`{ … }` a part that may repeat, and `"quoted text"` is a token written
exactly so; rules refer to one another until every chain ends in a
literal token, and any input that a chain of these rules accepts parses,
and anything else does not.

```text
program     = statement , { separator , statement } ;
separator   = ";" | newline ;

statement   = "break"
            | "continue"
            | "return" , expression
            | "if" , expression , "then" , statement , [ "else" , statement ]
            | "while" , expression , "do" , statement
            | "for" , name , "in" , expression , [ "to" , expression ,
                [ "step" , expression ] ] , "do" , statement
            | "solve" , expression
            | "const" , name , "=" , expression
            | "def" , name , "(" , [ params ] , ")" , defbody
            | pattern , "=" , expression
            | name , "=" , expression
            | expression ;
params      = name , { "," , name } ;
defbody     = "=" , expression
            | "do" , block , "end" ;
pattern     = "{" , name , { "," , name } , "}" ;
block       = statement , { separator , statement } ;

expression  = ifexpr ;
ifexpr      = "if" , expression , "then" , expression ,
              "else" , expression | orexpr ;
orexpr      = andexpr , { "or" , andexpr } ;
andexpr     = notexpr , { "and" , notexpr } ;
notexpr     = "not" , notexpr | comparison ;
comparison  = bitor , [ cmpop , bitor ] ;
cmpop       = ">" | "<" | ">=" | "<=" | "==" | "!=" ;
bitor       = bitand , { ( "|" | "xor" ) , bitand } ;
bitand      = shift , { "&" , shift } ;
shift       = additive , [ ( "<<" | ">>" ) , additive ] ;
additive    = term , { ( "+" | "-" ) , term } ;
term        = unary , { ( "*" | "/" ) , unary } ;
unary       = "-" , unary | "~" , unary | power ;
power       = postfix , [ "^" , unary ] ;
postfix     = primary , { "!" | "%" | index } ;
index       = "[" , expression , "]" ;
primary     = number | string | name | call
            | "(" , expression , ")"
            | list | matrix ;
call        = name , "(" , [ expression , { "," , expression } ] , ")" ;
list        = "{" , [ expression , { "," , expression } ] , "}" ;
matrix      = "[" , row , { "," , row } , "]" ;
row         = "[" , expression , { "," , expression } , "]" ;
```

Grammar notes the EBNF cannot say:

- The additive level also admits **unit conversion** after a term:
  `expression "in" unitpath` and `expression "->" unitpath`, looping
  so `3 m in ft in inch` chains.
- Inside a multiplicative chain, a `/` directly followed by a unit
  name (and not a call) continues a **unit path** rather than
  dividing: `60 mile/hr`, `5 m/s^2`.
- A statement beginning `{ name , … } =` is a destructuring; any
  other `{` begins a list expression (the parser rewinds).
- `end` closes a `def`'s `do` block; there is no standalone `do` statement.
- `in` is a keyword both in `for … in` and in unit conversion; the
  position disambiguates.
- Number literals absorb an `i` suffix into an imaginary token; based
  literals (`0b`, `0o`, `0x`) too.

## 16. Beyond the grammar: interactive commands

The language is what this page defines. The frontends add **commands**
around it, recognized before the parser sees the line; they are
conveniences, not part of the language definition:

| Command | Where | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `save name` | interactive frontends | persist a function or constant to the store |
| `save script name` | interactive frontends | persist the session as a named script |
| `graph expr` | REPL, TUI, PWA, desktop | draw a 2D plot of `expr` over the session's window |
| `graph3d expr` | REPL, TUI, PWA, desktop | draw a 3D surface |
| `language` | interactive frontends | switch the interface language |
| `quit`, `exit` | REPL | end the session |

Everything else — expression entry, scripts, the store — behaves as
this reference defines, identically on every frontend.

---

*This reference corresponds to epher 0.5.41 (staging). The function
and constant tables are extracted from `epher-core`'s dispatch and
catalog; a core test keeps them from drifting: renaming or removing a
builtin without updating this page fails the build.*
